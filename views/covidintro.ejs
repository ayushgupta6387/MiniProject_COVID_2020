          Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
          newly discovered coronavirus. <br /><br />
          Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to
          moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
          treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
          like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
          and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
          <br /><br />
          The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
          informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it
          spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
          hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your
          face.

        <p class="card-text">SOAP OR SANITISER?</p>
        <p>
          Sanitiser could seem like a more high-tech approach than a lowly bar
          of soap, and sanitisers with a very high ethanol content can act in a
          similar way to soap and interfere with the lipid membrane. However,
          they are generally not as effective as soap and water because the
          viral particles remain on the surface of the skin, rather than being
          rinsed away.
        </p>
        <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand
            rub.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
          </li>
          <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
          <li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth</li>
          <li>
            If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
            attention.
          </li>
          <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
          <li>
            Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you
            cough or sneeze.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Masks</h5>
        <p>
          Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing
          the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and
          should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow
          the advice provided by your local health authority.
